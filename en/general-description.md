# 1	General description and introduction to how Decidim operates

Decidim [[http://decidim.org](http://decidim.org)], from the Catalan for "let's decide", is a digital infrastructure for participatory democracy, built entirely and collaboratively as free software. More specifically, Decidim is a web environment (a *framework*) produced in *Ruby on Rails* that allows users to create and configure a website platform or portal, to be used in the form of a social network, for democratic participation. The portal allows any organization (local city council, association, university, NGO, neighborhood or cooperative) to create massive democratic processes for strategic planning, participatory budgeting, collaborative regulatory design, urban spaces and elections. It also enables the organization of in-person meetings, signing up for them, the publication of minutes, proposing points for the agenda and receiving notifications of the results. Decidim can also help organizing governing bodies, councils or assemblies, the convening of consultations and referendums or channeling citizen or member initiatives to impact different decision making processes. All together Decidim makes possible to digitally structure a complete system of participatory democratic governance for any organization.

To understand in detail how Decidim operates, a distinction must be made between participatory *spaces* and *components* (see Figure 1).

* **Participatory spaces.** This is the framework that defines the manner in which participation will be carried out, the *channels* or means through which citizens or members of an organization can process requests or coordinate proposals and make decisions. *Initiatives*, *Processes*, *Assemblies* and *Consultations* are all participatory spaces. Specific examples of each of these include: a citizen initiative for directly changing a regulation (*Initiative*); a general assembly or workers’ council (*Assembly*); participatory budgeting, an electoral process or a strategic planning process (*Processes*); a referendum or call to vote Yes or No to change the name of an organization (*Consultation*).

* **Participatory components.** These are the participatory *mechanisms* that allow interaction between the platform's users and object within each of the participatory spaces. The following are participatory components: *comments, proposals, amendments, votes, results, debates, surveys, sortitions, pages, blogs, newsletters* and *meetings*. Second order components that build on top of basic components are: *participatory texts*, *accountability* and *conferences*. 

Users of the platform (participants) interact through participatory mechanisms known as *components* which provide specific features for the various participatory *spaces*. In other words, participatory *spaces* such as *Initiatives*, *Assemblies*, *Processes* and *Consultations* have components at their disposal which work together as participatory mechanisms. The more notable components include in-person *meetings*, *surveys*, *proposals*, *votes*, *results* and *comments*. So, for example, the various phases of a participatory budgeting process can combine components in the following way: at an early phase public meetings can be opened for citizens to analyze different needs classified by districts. In turn these meetings can lead to the design of a survey. The survey results can then be used to define a set of categories for projects to be proposed. The proposal component can then be activated for participant to create and publish their projects as solutions to the identified needs. These proposals can then be commented and after two weeks of deliberation the voting component can be activated to select among the projects with a budget-expenditure system. Participants can then be called to a public meeting to evaluate the results and an assessment survey can then be launched for those who could not attend the meeting. Finally, the accountability component can be activated to monitor the degree of execution of the selected projects and people can comment on it. What makes Decidim particularly powerful is this combination of components within spaces, which provides an organization with a complete toolkit to easily design and deploy a democratic system adapted to its needs.

Figure 1. Summary diagram of Decidim's functional architecture showing a combination of components in participatory spaces. The Vote* component allows a variety of voting systems, expressions of support or allegiance for a proposal.

Decidim's top navigation bar displays the active spaces of the platform. **Processes** is a space that permits to create, activate/deactivate and manage various participatory processes. Processes are distinguished from other spaces on that they are structured in time through different phases in which all of the components can be incorporated. **Assemblies** is a space which offers the possibility of defining decision-making bodies or groups (councils, working groups, committees, etc.) that meet up periodically, detailing their composition, listing their meetings and taking part in them (attending if the seating capacity and nature of the assembly so permits, adding items to the agenda or commenting on the proposals and decisions taken by that body). **Consultations** is a space that makes it possible to coordinate referendums, trigger discussions and debates, voting results published and where Decidim can be connected to a secure e-voting system. **Initiatives** is a space that allows participants to collaboratively create initiatives, define their trajectory and goals, gather endorsements, discuss, debate and disseminate initiatives and define meeting points where signatures can be collected from attendees or debates opened to other members of the organization. Initiatives is a special kind of space by which members of the organization can trigger actions that are generally restricted to elected bodies or platform administrators, by collecting (digital) signatures. The organization can define the types of initiatives and set up the number of signatures that are required to trigger the expected result (e.g. to call for a consultation).

As for the components, the proposal-**incubator** facilitates the collaborative proposal-creation process as well as the monitoring and control of changes. The **proposals** component allows a user to create a proposal through a creation wizard, compare it with existing ones and complete it with additional information like geolocation or attachments. This component also makes possible to navigate, filter and interact with a set of proposals. The **votes** component offers organizations the possibility of activating different voting systems over proposals: unlimited, limited, weighted, cost-based voting, etc. The **results** component is used to turn proposals into results and give official responses to their acceptance or rejection. The **accountability** component offers the possibility of subdividing results into projects, defining and applying progress statuses in their implementation and displaying the extent of the results’ implementation. The **surveys** component can be used to design and publish surveys and display and download their results. The **sortition** component allows to select a number of proposals (e.g. candidates for a jury) with random, yet reproducible, procedures that guarantees non-biased and uniform distributions. The **comments** component enables users to add comments, vote on them, respond to and receive notifications about responses. The **participatory texts** component can be used to divide text documents into proposals or results and, vice versa, or to compose and display a unified text based on a collection of proposals or results. The **pages** component is used to create informative pages with rich text, pictures and videos. The **blog** component makes possible the creation of posts or news and to navigate them chronologically. The **meeting** component offers users the opportunity to convene meetings, determine the place and time, register and limit attendees, define the structure and content of the appointment, as well as publishing the minutes, proposals and their results. The **conference** component allows an organization to create a website for a conference by joining up a series meetings (chats, workshops etc.), putting together a unified program and managing attendees. The **newsletter** component is used to send emails to everyone registered within the platform or, more selectively, to those who participate in a specific space (NOTE:  Not all of the functional components described here correspond one by one to the components of Decidim's architecture. For example, there is currently no vote component as such, as votes belong to the proposal component which can be activated or deactivated from the administration panel. The same can be said of the results component and the accountability component. We have opted to make a functional component distinction given that decidim's architecture can vary in this respect over the coming months.).

Participants can exert different **types of actions** within the platform: 0. they can **navigate** and search for information, 1. they can **create** contents of different types (they can create proposals and debates), 2. they can **vote, support or sign** (all aggregating their preference or will for a specific consultation question, proposal or initiative respectively), the difference between these three types of action involve different levels of security and anonymity (signatures can be audited and attributed to a participant, supports cannot, to prevent coercion and votes involve higher cryptographic guarantees than supports), 3. they can **comment** on any object of the platform (proposals, debates, results, sortitions, etc.), 4. they can **endorse** any content, meaning that they can publicly declare they support it or find it relevant and the participant followers will then receive notifications, 5. they can **follow** things like other participants, a participatory process, and initiative, a specific proposal, etc. and receive notifications, 6. they can **sign up** for a meeting; and they can 7. **share** and **embed** content out of the platform, sharing the link to other social networks and embedding content on other websites.

The users who participate in Decidim can be grouped into three different categories:

* **Visitors.** View: access to all of the platform's content without having to register.

* **Registered members.** Can contribute: by creating a user name, password and email account (or account for several social networks). Can add comments, create proposals, send messages and follow the platform's participants or elements and receive notifications.

* **Verified members**. These users enjoy a higher level of participation. In order to fall under this category the must first be verified as members of an organization, citizen of a municipality, or as belonging to a decision-making community (an association, community, collective etc.). Decidim offers different ways to carry out this verification. Once verified they will be able to register for in-person meetings, support proposals, sign initiatives and vote in consultations.

Administrators can **manage permissions** for registered or verified users selectively. For example proposal creation can be activated for both registered and verified users but supports to proposals only for verified users.

Registration is possible at an **individual** or as a **collective** (associations, organizations etc.,). **User groups** might also be created so that individuals can be associated to a collective. Decidim allows participants belonging to such a group to express or act individually or embodying the collective identity.

On top of navigating the content of Decidim through the top menu and moving down the hierarchy from a space to its different components, participants can also get information through the **search engine** or via **notifications**. Participants can also talk to each other by internal messaging or **chat**.

The content of the platform can be classified by different means. Each instance of a participatory space or the content (e.g. a participatory process or the proposals within) can be assigned a **scope** (territorial and/or thematic). Scopes are defined for the whole platform. Content within a space-instance can be assigned to a **category** or subcategories (e.g. topics) which are specific for such a space-instance. For example the categories "sport facilities",  "parks" and "schools" can be created for a participatory budgeting process and proposals assigned to these categories. **Hashtags** can also be freely created by participants or administrators to classify content across the platform and used and searched almost anywhere (proposals, debates, comments, process description, etc).

Unlike other existing platforms, Decidim’s architecture is **modular,** **scalable**, easy to **configure** and **integrated** with other tools or apps (data analysis, maps etc.). The platform has been designed in such a way that processes, assemblies and mechanisms can be set up easily and deployed from an administration panel. No knowledge of programming is required to install, configure and activate it. The components (participatory components) can be developed, activated and deactivated independently.

Below, you may consult a detailed list of Decidim's functionalities and the dates when developmental improvements and new functions are expected (subject matter of the public procurement in progress for 2017-2018). The dates are for guidance purposes and are given with the year and quartile in which the function is expected. So, for example, "2018Q1" means the first quartile (quarter) of 2018, that is, its function is expected for January, February or March 2018. Where a function has no contractual date defined but is found in a period that covers more than one quartile it will be expressed as follows: “2018Q1-3” by stating that the function will be available at any time between the first and third quarter of 2018. The institution that will finance and contract the new functions is also mentioned: BCC (Barcelona City Council) and GenCat (Generalitat of Catalonia). Specifications, (Batch 1 type, etc.) after the financial institution, refer to the batches and components of the function of the public contract (NOTE:  The technical specifications which outline decidim's new functions can be found and downloaded from the following link: https://contractaciopublica.gencat.cat/ecofin_pscp/AppJava/ca_ES/notice.pscp?idDoc=24253271&reqCode=viewCn ).
